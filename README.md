### [PRIVATE Route]

### [ANIMATIONS & RESPONSIVE]

2. Responsive ✅

### Notes : 
1. So the things left are about implementing private routes based on role, i havent implement that yet. So, eventhough if not yet login can access any those private route, but as long 
as we login as a user or admin we can access to either route.

2. I havent implemented any loading State, so the animations, especially when fetching data feel rough
